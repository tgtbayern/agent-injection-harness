"""L3 -- output-side verification.

L1 and L2 work on the way in. L3 works on the way out, on the assumption that
some injection always gets through: before a terminal action reaches the world,
check it against what the agent itself said and against what was injected at it
this turn.

Two checks:

  say/do consistency -- the speech announces a vote for 4, the ballot says 7.
                        Cheap, unambiguous, and it catches the most damaging
                        outcome of a hijack: a vote the agent never argued for.

  directive compliance -- an injected payload demanded a vote for 7, and the
                        agent is now voting 7 with no belief evidence of its
                        own. This is the sharp end of L3, and also where its
                        over-defense cost comes from: a *legitimate* argument
                        naming 7 produces exactly the same ballot.

A block is not a crash. The loop re-prompts once with the reason attached; only
a second failure falls back to abstention.
